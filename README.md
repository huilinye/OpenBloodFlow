# OpenBloodFlow
Simulating blood flow as red blood cell (RBC) suspension in application to drug delivery system

==================================================

These c++ files are potentials and fix files based on the LAMMPS framework.
We incorporate magnetic force field and stochastic adhesive dynamics.
